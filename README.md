## What this is

BeHappy Web is the official web client for the BeHappy messenger. It
is built on top of the Telegram Web A codebase under GPL v3, with the
following high-level modifications:

- Networking layer (custom GramJS) rewritten to use the **MVSy 1.0**
  protocol and connect to BeHappy backend servers (instead of MTProto
  2.0 / Telegram DCs).
- Branding, visual identity, and product naming replaced throughout.
- Telegram-specific features removed where not applicable to BeHappy
  (e.g., Telegram Premium subscriptions, Telegram Stars, Fragment
  integration, sponsored messages).
- Additional features added that are unique to BeHappy.

The complete list of changes from upstream is tracked in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The upstream changelog is preserved in
[`UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md`](UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md) for reference.

independently maintained.

## Local setup

```sh
